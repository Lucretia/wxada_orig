wxAda progamming style guide
============================

* Use 2 spaces for indentation on each level.

* Capitalise identifiers and use underscores to separate words, i.e. This_Is_An_Identifier rather than this_is_an_identifier.

* Do not "use" a package, only "with" it; this way everything is obvious to the reader as to where a particular operation is coming from.

* Use the Identifier "Self" to specify the controlling operand for a primitive operation.

* All C functions which are interfaces to the C++ wxWidgets library must be placed in the relevant private interface package, e.g.
  wx.Base.Object.C contains the constructor and destructor for wxObject's.

* Any cyclic dependencies must be worked around by creating a dummy type in it's own package with relevant Initialise and Finalize
  procedures which raise Program_Error. This dummy type can then be used safely in the problem package, e.g. wx.Core.Window.Set_Sizer
  and wx.Core.Root_Sizer.Root_Sizer_Type.

* Include the standard comment at the top of each source file, specifying the filename, licence and copyright holder(s). Add any
  extra notes into this comment.

* Follow the wxWidgets class hierarchy as closely as possible and map this to Ada packages.

* Only provide wxAda types for wxWidgets classes that are not provided in Ada or the standard runtime, hence, wxThread, wxString, etc.
  are not provided by wxAda.

* Modify wxWidgets identifiers to more readable names where appropriate, e.g. wx.Core.Window.Find_Window is overloaded rather than
  having multiple names wxWindow::FindWindow, wxWindow::FindWindowByName, wxWindow::FindWindowById, etc.
