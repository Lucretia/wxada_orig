# wxAda (original)

These are the remnants I have left of my original wxAda project. This was originally stored on Tigris in an SVN repository. I didn't receive any emails from Tigris regarding it's deletion so I never managed to get a full svnadmin dump to move into Git as a historical back up, therefore there is no history.

This project is archived for two reasons:

1. I consider this project dead, but wanted the code around so people can see how difficult it is to bind to C++ from other languages.
2. I had started a while back an automated binding generator, it's just not finished or ready.
