-- Notes:
--   In C++ the wxObject class handles creation of new instances from this class knowing the string name of the class. Also,
--   it allows handles RTTI, we don't really need this functionality in Ada, due to the 'Class and 'Tag attributes.
--   Should referencing be handled?
--   What would be the point of being able to copy instances of these types? Would it actually work? I don't know. Come back to this later.
--   For types that derive from wxWindow, in the Finalization procedure, call Destroy to remove the window from the hierarchy.
--     This will handle the deletion of the window and we can then set the wxCXX_Object back to null.
--   Use exceptions for errors.
